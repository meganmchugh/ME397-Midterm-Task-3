# ME397-Midterm-Task-3
Task 3: In groups of 3, you will create a simple GitHub repository where you will each edit a
document a few times. For instance, one person will create a repository and a README.md file
with some text. The second person will pull that repository to their own local machine, edit the
README file by adding some lines to it, and deleting others. The third person will do the same
as the second and then each will do it one more time. Thus each person in the group will edit the
document at least twice. You will need to invite me (joshdr83) to the repository so that I can
view the changes made to the document from each user.
Deliverables for Task 3: Evidence if you all having done Task 3 by me observing the history of
the README file on the Repository.
